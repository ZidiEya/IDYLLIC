🔵 🎉 More info 💬 🎉 💫
          
           i conceived and built IDYLLIC for my end-of-the-year project as student at Holberton School, a 
           full-stack software engineering school in Tunisia. This project is inspired from ebay .
           the most difficult technical challenge i encountered is that MongoDB is time-consuming to manage and maintain .
           Due to its master-slave architecture, the topology of a MongoDB deployment can be complex and increasingly 
           complicated as i try to scale it. Deploying MongoDB requires lots of manual configurations and includes 
           numerous components: routers, config servers, arbiters, primary instances, secondary instances. i spend almost 
           3days to search how to figure out the configuration. this challenge was really difficult because
           it’s the first time i build a web application with MongoDB as document database ,i needed to reed so many r
           esources and to ask for help because i struggled a lot to connect the back-end with database and to configure t
           he database but in the end i solved the problem on my own .it was very challenging I made the back-end and 
           front-end of this web application by myself in approximately 1 month.

🔵what comes next for the project✌️💫
           
           In order to improve the site I will add an interface for buyers customers  ,
           In which they will be able to sectionize the products they want to buy and order the products  
           and have the total purchase price .
